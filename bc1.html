said, "Who is facing me?"<br>Bodhidharma replied, "I don't
know." <br>The Emperor did not understand. <br>After this
Bodhidharma crossed the Yangtse River and came to the kingdom of Wei.&nbsp;Later the Emperor brought this up to Master Chih and asked
him about it. <br>Master Chih asked, "Does your majesty know
who this man is?" <br>The Emperor said, "I don't know." <br>Master
Chih said, "He is the Mahasattva Avalokitesvara, transmitting
<br>the Buddha Mind Seal." The Emperor felt regretful, so he
wanted to send an emissary to go invite [Bodhidharma to return]. <br>Master Chih told him, "Your majesty, don't say that
you will send someone to fetch him back. Even if everyone in
the whole country were to go after him, he still wouldn't return."&nbsp;</p>

<br>of a fence, right away you know there's an ox there. To understand three when one is raised, to judge precisely at a glancethis is the everyday food and drink of a patchrobed monk. Getting to where he cuts off the myriad streams, he is free to arise
in the east and sink in the west, to go against or to go with, in
any and all directions, free to give or to take away. But say, at
just such a time, whose actions are these? Look into Hsueh
Tau's trailing vines.&nbsp;</p>

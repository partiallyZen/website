            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">It was the third day that the gravity was offline. There is something almost therapeutic, or cathartic, about seeing familiar rooms floating at strange angles. Items usually set on tables sent spinning in methodic beautiful patterns. It was times like these I regretted The Republic taking steps to 'trim the fat' off the newest class of starship. But it also made a comical climb across the wall of the basketball court. The side, now half filled with the pool, made for a slightly longer route through the sub-systems to the lower levels. The scent of chlorine water filled my nose as I floated to the next bay-door. The tech and security team were already suited up with their Oz nodes and driving around their newest robotic creations hoping to find a solution. I shivered as the tech crew lowered the technical half-centipede, half-spider into the water.

</div><div>
</div><div>As I finally arrived at my room, I found the gravity unchanged. Paper, tablets, clothes, and other personal goods floated in the air. I pushed off the wall to get to my desk and hit the illuminated panel with an outstretched finger. Bringing up the [SAU] option, activating my Sorting Assistance Unit. A hatch in the back of the room opened and emitted a quiet slurping sound. The smallest objects began to move first, starting a Fantasia-esque parade to the back of the room. A small probe ejected from the wall near the vacuum tunnel and floated around collecting and storing the goods in their various drawers and closets. The objects crashed and separated, all while falling towards their inevitable doom; robotic storage. As I was sitting, a book slowly wandered past my vision. "Existentialism and Human Emotions" by Jean-Paul Sartre. The well-used book was already opened to a favorite page, intercepting it I read until the sucking noise stopped and my desk illuminated one more time [SORT COMPLETE] A sorted list of items followed, noticeably sideways, and were placed in the various closets and drawers. I pulled myself into my desk chair, buckling my belt so as to stay in the seat as I looked at the display.

</div><div>[08:15:23-04/07/2313] It was the U.S. Independence day, something that was long lost in the shuffle off-world. The U.S.E. was all that the crew knew of now. The computer followed with a blinking '3 unread' in an almost garish red. Clicking it with a finger brings up another display window; 1. XXXX - UNKNOWN ORIGIN [5'55"] 2. SOL - EB2 - JACK HORNSBY [3'28"] 3. MERCHER - SATELLITE 23B - [2'00"]
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"How do they get advertisements all the way out here?" The walls gave their usual retrospection as I clicked MERCHER into the 'trash'. A hilarious representation of a trashcan, something I could only imagine from classic videos from the days of Terra. I once saw a brief clip of some strange green monster living inside of one as a home. I chuckled, the image burnt into my head paired with one of my sisters laughing at the video clip. I remember thinking it was so childish. What I would give to see her face now...
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>With another swipe of my finger, an image blinked to life with a message given by the loving face of my uncle Jack Hornsby. His signature mustache quivered with excitement as he continued to talk about the new EarthBase [EB2] they were creating, even going so far as to invite me to move in as soon as my task was finished. It was his pride to imagine us together farming and re-colonizing the Earth's surface. It was something we both knew we would never do but that never stopped him. At every station, It seems all I hear is people complaining about the difficulties of being off-world. A Terran without a terra. I never found it that difficult, always one to find a quiet place to read or collate data. The space between here and the nearest Terran colony, Elon 1, wasn't even a thought as there would be no one there to greet me. As I examined the readings from the sensors off-handedly and noticed several irregularities. It was as if Mars was seething, pulsing energy from its midsection. The most likely candidate is a strange crystalline structure The Republic has been researching. This non-native crystal appears to have been part of a recent meteor storm. It glows and Uncle Jack thinks that he might be able to glean power out of it. This must've been the main reason my Uncle contacted me. He wants information on these crystals for EB2 as a power resource. Even if I assure him every time that I can not access that type of information. Even if I can, why should I?
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Letting the thought quickly drift out of mind, I flicked the last message.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"Hey bud..."
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It was a video log and it looked exactly like me if a little worse for wear in the form of scars crisscrossing his [my] face.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"This is going to be really really confusing, but hold on tight. Something is coming. Something that you will not be ready for. You need to go to EB2 and find Uncle Jack, he is in far deeper than he knows. Don't trust anyone. It is likely that it has already infected the ship, hence the malfunctioning gravity. But soon it will start to infect organics and you do not want to be around when that happens."
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>My mind reeling, I thought of how this would end. Is this an elaborate prank or Uncle Jack messing with me? The message continued.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"And just because I haven't ever talked to anyone about this, if you don't listen to me it will be more painful than that time you crashed the family car." The video log then winked knowingly and shut off.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I never told anyone about that...

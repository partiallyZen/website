            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mare steered around the misty lava fall in her canoe, many of her closest friends joined upon their own boats. Her lover, inflamed by Mare’s passion, was first on her boat and beat even the esteemed boatswoman to ready the boat for her arrival. Sheana was told, as the others were, that once they crossed that they would not be allowed to return until their task was complete. There were eight in total that joined Mare. Included were Faed and Dauk, Chantra and Anele, and Arthus (one of the foremost poets). They were pulled towards Mare’s radiant design and they sang songs of longing for the freedom that the sea would provide. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing Dauk to explain the finer points of construction, the group began to collect lumber from the nearby forest. Collecting them into a large pile on the beach. Dauk because unsure of the decision he made for him and his wife Sheana. And so Dauk sat upon the glistening white sand and meditated as the sunset and rose once more. On the dawn of the next day, Dauk stood having heard the song of the waves and words of a sea being sailing over the waves. It was told that with this connection came plentiful new ideas to Dauk.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, as Duak watched all of the others slept peacefully. In the morning, he spoke with the others and told them of all that he had heard and the boon it provided him. Full of ideas Dauk continued there instruction with more fervor. They continued to follow his order, but the seeds of doubt planted tend to grow. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they began work on the first sailing prototype at the guidance of Dauk. During it’s creation, Dauk and his partner dubbed it “The Reef”. It was a wide bottomed ship of lightweight design aimed to crest the mountainous waves found pounding the Arenum.  The leathery sails made of animal skin and treated with oil to stave off the moisture during travel. Launched (on the morn of 96 B.C.) it took flight quickly but a swell turned her and Dauk and Faed were thought lost.
</div><div>On the next day, many were full of the strains of woe. Mare, however, still demanded that they continue their labor. A few disobeyed but most, filled with Mare’s passion, began construction of a secondary boat. 
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Dauk and his otherworldly assistance, the boat was far inferior. The boat would not even make it out to see and broke apart in the first tide of B.C. 90. After 18 cycles of labor, all that Mare and her kin had to show was a lost boatman of the highest order. And a wreck, visible to all of the beach’s onlookers.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sect of the oldest beings to watch this plane. In the beginning, they were not unlike you or I. They wandered in loving freedom from the Hyacinthos to the Flavon. For millennia untold they learned of plant and tree, bloom and bud. They went even as far as to traverse the haunted Eastern Mountains of Hyacinthos which were dangerous even in the early days. In the west, they crossed the more friendly Flavon to meet upon the western shores and avoid the Great Wasteland. The traveled with abandon filled with pride by every new step. Their adventures provided more to learn. Yearning for the secrets of land, sea, and air. At last, they settled on the great western beaches of Arenum and for the first time in their long history began to build. These tasks (or duties) were called the “Labors of Love”. [Before Cataclysm 150: ≈1500 BCE]
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labors were many and varied as the love of beings does. Transportation on land, sea, and sky. For the elder kin were full of pride for how many steps could be taken without taking any. Some composed stories and song. With this came words, paper, and notes. Before this, they spoke of nods and shrugs, eyebrows and movements of the hands. Though it would be years before they were perfected and the world was thoroughly changed. At first, it appeared as though the formulation of ideas, thoughts, and feelings into words was a creation that would bind the Ancients together in an inseparable bond but some of them had other goals. 
</div><div>They begin to give names to the plant and animal life that they encountered, imbuing them with something new. They created hues, scents, feelings, and things to feel. And the cycle turned. [B.C. 136]
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together they shaped the world around them in a common tongue, spoken by all. Save one. Canaeg was filled with a new feeling of pain at the sound of the new words. Unable to express his new emotion it progressed to hatred. In secret, he created words of his own but the words were harsh and corrupted with his hatred. But some listened, hearing their pain in his. They become his closest friends and he dubbed them kin. Or so he thought. And with his new words, Canaeg began to feel the power, a power that had not yet shown its face upon the world. 
</div><div>All the while, Regideaux, and his followers codified and expounded the common tongue “Eloquia Veritas” the Words of Truth. [BC 134] They composed of ballads and epics regarding their harrowing travels through the Hyacinthos to the white sands of Arenum in which they now resided. 
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Joy and happiness filled their songs. With the pride of Eloquia they had created, they sang, laughed, and danced all the days through. Inflamed with his inability to join them, Canaeg secluded himself in a cave within the mountains. [B.C. 133] He vowed to show others his power as he hid. So he continued to work, plagued by his loneliness. For years uncounted he practiced and he played. Tried, failed, and succeeded in his numerous attempts. It grew obvious that he alone could only get so far. More voices were needed to find the true power that he was seeking. &nbsp;</span><br></div><div>&nbsp;In the dead of a long night, he spirited away from his dank hovel, back to the Arenum. Into the tents of his sleeping brothers and sisters. He looked for another who knew some of his harsh tongue. It was her, Leiga, in this darkest night he found her and spoke his words. She heard the power of his voice. It is unknown if by wish or promise they sped away. Back to Canaeg’s secret lair high in the caverns. Into the shadowy air in the dead of night they spoke whispered words untold. [B.C. 115] And so,<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;they created a new song. They sang a song of sorrow for the lost.&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beach, a female named Mare awoke to the song of sorrow. The song awoke in her a feeling of deep longing as she stared out at the clear sheen of the water. This longing was a return of the days before. A longing to travel and see what lays behind the blue horizon. It was at this time [B.C. 99] that she spoke of this in great depth to Regideaux who thought the idea absurd. The crude canoes that Mare and her kin used to travel the beach would never traverse the great water. He spoke words that were truthful and honest but in Mare’s heart grew ambition. She would build a great boat and take her real brothers and sisters into the sea. Show them a life of adventure to those who would, by choice, join her. 
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regideaux, bothered by the idea of losing another of his kindred in just a short time, began to work on his own project. A codification of laws, rules for his followers to live by without question as they would be logical. Meanwhile, Mare and her followers used their boats to travel around the lava river and onto the northern beach. [B.C. 98]
